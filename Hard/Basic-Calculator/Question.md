224. **Basic Calculator**

Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.<br>

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().<br>

Example 1:<br>
Input: s = "1 + 1"<br>
Output: 2<br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "<br>
Output: 3<br>

Example 3:<br>
Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"<br>
Output: 23<br>

Constraints:<br>
1 <= s.length <= 3 \* 105<br>
s consists of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and ' '.<br>
s represents a valid expression.<br>
'+' is not used as a unary operation (i.e., "+1" and "+(2 + 3)" is invalid).<br>
'-' could be used as a unary operation (i.e., "-1" and "-(2 + 3)" is valid).<br>
There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.<br>
Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.
