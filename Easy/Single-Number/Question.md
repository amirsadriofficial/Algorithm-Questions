136. **Single Number**

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.<br>

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.<br>

Example 1:<br>
Input: nums = [2,2,1]<br>
Output: 1<br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]<br>
Output: 4<br>

Example 3:<br>
Input: nums = [1]<br>
Output: 1<br>

Constraints:<br>
1 <= nums.length <= 3 _ 104<br>
-3 _ 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 \* 104<br>
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
